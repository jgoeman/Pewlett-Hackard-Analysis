# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Description
There are two main purposes for this anlayis.
- Update Pewlett Hackard from using Excel and VBA for records to a more robust system using SQL.
- Prepare the company for the future by creating tables to help compile information about employees that will be retiring soon. Specifically the following items were requested in addition to other tables:
  1. The number of retiring Employees by Title. This table shows 
  2. Employees eligible for the mentorship program

## Results
- The number of employees retiring by title shows that Pewlet Hackard has its work cut out for it:
  1. The numbers on this table are staggering. There are over 90,000 employees retiring in the next few years. 
  2. Of the employees retiring over 50% of them are either Senior Engineers or Senior Staff members.Without even looking at the total employess that will need to be replaced The training alone that would go in replacing the senior staff is daunting. When looking at the total staff that need to be replaced the question that comes up is: Is this even possible?

- The table for Employees eligible for mentorship program gives Pewlet Hackard even more issues:
  1. Only 1549 total employees qualify for the mentorship program. This is obviously not enough employees. When looking at the results above with over 90,000 employees retiring in the next few years. 
  2. Each employee eligible for the mentorship program would need to mentor approximately 58 other employees to cover the total vacancies being left by retirement.

## Summary
There are two key questions that arise as the previous data is looked at.
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?    
If each spot is filled 90,398 employees will need to be replaced. Further data should be looked into to see if some of these positions can be consolidated to allow for less employees with a greater emphasis on automating with technology? 

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?    
No there are currently not enough employees to mentor as stated above the ratio of of mentor to employee would currently approximately be 1 to 58.
Currently employees born in 1965 are considered for the mentorship program, but if employees are considered from 1964 to 1965 the amount of mentors increases from 1549 to 19,905 total eligible employees for the mentor program. Pewlet Hackard should find a way to go in this direction if they would like to make this program successful.
